# Model Files

Model files are not included in this repository due to their large size (total ~455 MB).

## Download Models

Please download the model files from one of the following sources:

- **Google Drive**: [Add your link here]

## Required Files

Place the following files in this `models/` directory:

- `vgg16_Flatten.keras` (129.1 MB)
- `vgg16_GAP.keras` (113.26 MB)
- `vgg19_Flatten.keras` (212.38 MB)

## File Structure

After downloading, your models folder should look like:
```
models/
├── README.md (this file)
├── vgg16_Flatten.keras
├── vgg16_GAP.keras
└── vgg19_Flatten.keras
```

The application will automatically create this directory if it doesn't exist, but you need to manually download and place the model files here.
